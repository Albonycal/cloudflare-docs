# Logpush - Workers for Platforms

Logpush allows you to:
* Capture historical errors
* Aggregate metrics you may want to expose to your customer, like number of innovations, etc
* Get CPU data from a Worker
    
To get raw HTTP logs, we recommend using our Logpush service: 

* [Configuration](/logs/get-started/api-configuration/)
* [Available fields](/logs/reference/log-fields/zone/http_requests)
